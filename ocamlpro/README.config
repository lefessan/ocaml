Differences between configuration files between 4.01.0 and 4.01.0+ocp1
======================================================================

config/Makefile:
================

The following modifications where made, when the config/Makefile is
generated by ./configure for +ocp1:

1/ Variables BINDIR, LIBDIR and MANDIR are expansed (the paths appear
 completely instead of being related to $(PREFIX). WHY ?

2/ There is a new variable OCAMLLIBDIR=lib/ocaml that shows where
 OCaml files are installed relatively to $(PREFIX). It is needed for
 the relocation, since the files are searched relatively to the
 location of ocamlc.

3/ We compile with different defaults:
  3.1/ debug mode. -g is added everywhere.
  3.2/ frame-pointer mode. -fno-omit-frame-pointer is added on Linux.
  3.3/ -rdynamic to CCLIBs options. Why ?

4/ We define new variables MKLIB1 and MKLIB2 that split the MKLIB variable.
  WHY ?

5/ RUNTIMED is "runtimed" instead of "noruntimed". We build executable in
  custom by default. Note: this should be disabled once ocaml is installed.

6/ New variable OCP_RELOCATABLE=true

Differences between configuration files between 4.01.0 and 4.02.1
=================================================================

Most changes come from a start of implementation of cross-compilation.

config/Makefile:
================

1/ New variable CAMLRUN with the full path of ocamlrun. Used in Makefiles when
    calling ocamlrun. Probably because when cross-compiling, we want to use
    another one.
2/ New variable UNIX_OR_WIN32=unix. Used in byterun/Makefile, asmrun/Makefile
    and otherlibs/bigarray/Makefile, probably when cross-compiling, to choose
    the correct unix.c/win32.c file.
3/ New variable UNIXLIB=unix, used to select the correct unix library in
    most tools (debugger, ocamlbuild, ocamldoc, bigarray, threads)
4/ New variable GRAPHLIB=graph, used to select the correct graph library
    for ocamldoc.
5/ Use of variable PTHREAD_LINK changed from -cclib -lpthread to -lpthread
6/ New variable PTHREAD_CAML_LINK holds former content of PTHREAD_LINK. Both
  used in otherlibs/systhreads/Makefile.
7/ Variable DEBUGGER replaced by WITH_DEBUGGER=ocamldebugger
8/ New variable WITH_OCAMLDOC=ocamldoc
9/ New variable WITH_OCAMLBUILD=ocamlbuild
10/ Old variable CAMLP4 disappeared
11/ New variable TARGET=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu. Used in
  config/Makefile.mingw* to select the toolchain (TOOLPREF and HOST).
  Propagated to Config.target, used in Bytelink to decide whether
  DLLs should be checked (if equal to Config.host).
12/ New variable HOST=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu. Propagated to Config.host

config/m.h
==========

1/ Variables ARCH_INT64_TYPE, ARCH_UIN64_TYPE and ARCH_INT64_PRINTF_FORMAT
  were removed.
2/ New variable SIZEOF_LONGLONG=8 to select these values directly in
  byterun/config.h

config/s.h
==========

1/ New variables HAS_MKSTEMP and HAS_NICE
2/ Removed variable HAS_LIBBFD
