* Why does the testsuite not compile correctly ?
  * You need to use "TERM= OCAMLPARAM=_,g=0 make all", otherwise,
      * getopt.ml will fail (debugging disables optimizations)
      * ocaml error messages are different

* Why do I get inconsistent assumptions between ocamlopt.opt and
  {ocamlc.opt, ocamlc, ocamlopt} ?
  * Because you didn't patch toplevel/genprintval.ml which introduces
    new identifiers.
