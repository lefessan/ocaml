Modifications of flexlink:

* New option -ocaml, to build an OCaml executable. Instead of linking only
   flexdll_initer_XXX.o, it will also link flexdll_ocaml_XXX.o (containing
   platform specific functions)
* New variable FLEXLINK_VERBOSE that can be set to any number to set the
   verbosity of flexlink.
